-- |Injective types. This module contains the 'Injective' typeclass and instances
--  for the following equivalence classes:
--
--  * @{Strict Text, Lazy Text, String}@. 'ByteString's are not part of this,
--    since there exists more than one way to turn unicode text into a ByteString
--    (see "Data.Text.Encoding" and "Data.Text.Lazy.Encoding").
--  * @{Whole, Integer}@. Be advices, though, that Peano numbers may contain
--    unobservable infinities (i.e. @infinity = S infinity@) and thus,
--    the conversion to Integer may not terminate.
--  * @{Nat, Natural}@. For finite values, they're extensionally equivalent,
--    but 'Nat' has lazy infinity.
--
--  Additional injections:
--
--  * Maybe to Either (the reverse is not true, since different 'Left' values
--    would all be converted to 'Nothing').
--  * Integers to Rational.
--  * Natural numbers to Integer and Rational.
